# Brainfloj

__A Clojure wrapper around openBCI's BrainFlow API__

**BrainFloj** is a Clojure wrapper for the [BrainFlow](https://brainflow.org) API for real-time EEG data streaming, analysis, and interaction. It connects directly to BrainFlow’s Java API, giving you full access to biosignal data from supported devices — with the expressive power of functional, data-driven Clojure code.
